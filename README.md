# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.
The Hermit lives among the boulders, He wears no grament but a sack;
By low degrees his reason moulders, The sun has long since burnt him black.
The Lazar, blessed with an appearanceEnough to give the strongest qualms, 
Has little need of perseverance in promting a display of alms.
